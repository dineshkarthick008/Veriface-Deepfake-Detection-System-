## 🧐 Problem Statement
With the rise of Generative AI, creating hyper-realistic fake videos ("Deepfakes") has become dangerously easy. These videos can be used for misinformation, identity theft, and fraud. **VeriFace** aims to provide a simple, accessible tool for the public to verify video authenticity.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Frontend:** Streamlit (Custom CSS for UI)
* **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow / Keras
* **Face Detection:** MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks)
* **Computer Vision:** OpenCV

## ⚙️ How It Works
1.  **Input:** User uploads an `.mp4` video file.
2.  **Preprocessing:** The system scans the video and extracts frames.
3.  **Face Detection:** **MTCNN** identifies and crops faces from the frames.
4.  **Analysis:** The cropped faces are fed into the **MesoNet** neural network.
5.  **Output:** The model assigns a probability score (Real vs. Fake) and displays the verdict.
